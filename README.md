## Project to study clean architecture (-ish)

### Goal

Create a simple app to upload images and Should be able to have multiples styles and different implementations
but the presentation layer (react components, etc) shouldn't know anything about the api communication, etc.

I need to create three differents options to implement the upload api.

- Local Storage;
- Graphql;
- Rest API

I need to create three different options to upload the image or save the image link.

- A form with upload button and a button to show a input to add the image URL.
- A form with upload button and always show the url input.
- A form with upload button only.
